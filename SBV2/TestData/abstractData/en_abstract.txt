This  paper  confirms  that  the  combination  of  the  technological  development  of  digitalization 
with  the  established  course  reserve  service  is  possible  in  compliance  with  copyright  law  in 
Germany  and  leads  to  added  value  for  all  stakeholders  in  the  process.  This  research  is 
based  on  a  comparative  analysis  of  literature.  A  reference  process  containing  the  strategic 
and  the  operational  level  of  the  electronic  reserve  service  is  developed  using  the  Business 
Process Modeling Notation (BPMN), thereby illustrating the additional benefit of the new pr
o-
cess  for  all  participants.  Different  implementation  options  for  the  associated  tasks  are  d
e-
scribed  independent  of  software  solutions  available  on  the  market.  In  addition,  the  study 
identifies universal approaches to closer integration within the university. Another aspect ou
t-
lined is the identification of potential for cross-university cooperation. The study is completed 
by developing a procedure to implement the new process in the specific context of conditions 
at the TU Berlin. 
The reference process can be used for the implementation of course reserve services at any 
other university. For its implementation individual parameters have to be analyzed additiona
l-
ly,  the  technical  level  of  the  process  model  has  to  be  supplemented  and  its  procedure 
adapted.
